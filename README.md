# About me:
## - I want to learn coding to be able to solve problems that occur everyday or spontaneous.
## - I have some basic Java skills.
## - I had to use BlueJ but I use IntelliJ in my free time.
## - If you are interested in helping me to learn, just let me know.
## - I hope to find small projects to collaborate on even with lower skill level but the chance to improve.
## - I love Star Wars and I listen to Metal.
